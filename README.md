hypergraph  [Under Construction]
==========

This library provides a general hypergraph implementation, as well as several important and canonical algorithms that operate on hypergraphs.

Expected v1.0 release: July 2014

Testing
---------

Tests go in `tests/`.

Run tests with `python setup.py test`.

Test runner depends on
[pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html).

Travis CI checks for pep8 compliance on all code. 

If your code doesn't meet pep8 compliance the test suite will report a failure.
