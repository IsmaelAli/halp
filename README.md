halp: Hypergraph Algorithms Package<br>
==========

This library provides a general hypergraph implementation, as well as several important and canonical algorithms that operate on hypergraphs.

See [http://tmmurali.github.io/halp/](http://tmmurali.github.io/halp/) for documentation, code examples, and more information.

Testing
---------

Tests are located in `tests/`, and can be run with `python setup.py test`.

Test runner depends on
[pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html).

Travis CI checks for pep8 compliance on all code. If the code doesn't meet pep8 compliance, the test suite will report a failure.
